# Simplifying the Grid

The breakout grid includes 5 column levels by default. If your project doesn't need all of them, you can collapse unused tracks to zero width. The grid lines still exist (so utilities won't break), but they take no space.

## Collapsing Unused Tracks

Set any track width to `'0px'` in your config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
import breakoutGrid from '@astuteo/tailwind-breakout-grid'

export default {
  plugins: [
    breakoutGrid({
      // Collapse popout if you only need full → feature → content
      popoutWidth: '0px',
    })
  ]
}
```

## Common Simplified Configurations

### Minimal: Just Full and Content

For simple editorial layouts that only need two widths:

```js
breakoutGrid({
  featureWidth: '0px',
  popoutWidth: '0px',
})
```

This gives you:
- `col-full` - Edge to edge
- `col-content` - Comfortable content width (53-61rem fluid)

The `col-feature` and `col-popout` classes still work—they just resolve to the same width as `col-content`.

### No Popout Level

If you want full, feature, and content but don't need popout:

```js
breakoutGrid({
  popoutWidth: '0px',
})
```

### Narrower Content Column

If you want a narrower reading column (closer to traditional ~40-50rem reading width):

```js
breakoutGrid({
  contentMin: '40rem',
  contentMax: '50rem',
  contentBase: '52vw',
})
```

## Why This Works

CSS Grid handles zero-width tracks efficiently—they're just collapsed grid lines with no performance cost. The grid-line names (`content-start`, `feature-end`, etc.) still exist, so all `col-*` utilities continue to work. They just resolve to the nearest non-zero track.

This approach is better than conditionally removing tracks because:

1. **Your utilities always work** - No need to remember which tracks exist in each project
2. **Simpler code** - The plugin doesn't need complex conditional logic
3. **Easy to expand later** - Just change `'0px'` to a real value if needs change
